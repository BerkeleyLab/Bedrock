Marble demo project

Microprocessor "MMC" feature wish-list:
  keep MAC&IP values in Flash, reset on long push-button
  change MAC&IP on command, within 30 seconds of short push-button (flicker LEDs)
  push MAC&IP to FPGA after FPGA boot
  poll server (simple counter at first), reset FPGA after 30 seconds of failure
  accumulate entropy from ADC
  do something with UART so hardware can be tested
  eventually speak DHCP to get IP based on MAC (configurable option)
  eventually participate in Siphash key management

Gateware feature wish-list:
  no soft core needed, right?
  should be usable as a golden image, as well as hardware verification
  step 1: [DONE] add i2cbridge and SPI micro hookup to a copy of badger/tests/rgmii_hw_test.v
  step 2: [DONE] add UDP for boot flash programming
  step 2a: add UDP for self-JTAG
  step 3: do something with UART so hardware can be tested
  step 4: add FMC tester support code
  step 5a: [DONE] add SPI control of WR DACs (2 x AD5662, separate SYNC#)
  step 5b: start on some kind of White Rabbit support or at least phase-locking VCXO
  step 6: test framework for DDR3, use LiteDRAM?
  The above steps are mostly orthogonal and could be pursued in parallel if we had a larger team

Other work:
  learn how to program FT4232H config EEPROM
    add device_desc and serial number, leave vid and pid alone?
    learn how to program/debug LPC1776 - [DONE] see bringup.txt
  test LPC1776 UART over USB
  use MMC to test features on I2C_PM bus: 2 x LM75 (thermometers),
    MAX6639 (thermometers, thermal shutdown, fans), XRP7724 (power supply)
  add MAC hookup to spi_gate, maybe try to use ENC28J60 paradigms?
    (leave room in SPI plan for Siphash keys)

Wishlist for next rev of Marble Mini (relative to v1.0rc3)
  fix errata according to Michal:
- USB FTDI - reset pin connect to VUSB
- remove R225
- remove F1 and F2
- rotate LEDs
- FPGA JTAG connector pin connect to P2V5
- wrong transistors, BSS139 -> BSS138
- change S25FL128S to S25FL128SAGMFIR01
  fix errata
    LED orientation
    transistor part number (details below)
    two white-wires
    mark R225 as dnf (at least for S25FL128S case)
  rubber feet (with designated location) for desk use
  mounting holes (standoffs)? (overlap with rubber feet)
  physical power switch (includes barrel and PoE but not AMC?)
  direct-attach LED or two to FPGA, maybe on interrupt line to MMC?
  on-board SiLabs oscillator instead of U.Fl
  more (labeled) test points, esp. power supplies
  if keeping J14 "Cortex Debug Connector" make a big pin-1 marking
  more labels in general, e.g., DONE by associated LED
  power meter (another IN219) on 12V bulk input
    barrel-\         /---fans
    PoE--------vvv-------XR
    AMC----/         \---FMC
      (but MMC supply is not powered from that path, so not included)
  move Q19 to bottom of board to avoid needing a second reel for that part
  see if we can use one BOM line (on one side) for all push-buttons
  move U29 (I2C thermometer) to other end of board, near VCXOs
  NAD builds can mark S1 as DNF
  AMC builds should mark Pmod J12, J13, J16 as DNF
  reduce BOM line count in general
  improve testablity in general
