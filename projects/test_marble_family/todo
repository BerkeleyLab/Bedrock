Marble demo project

Microprocessor "MMC" feature wish-list:
  keep MAC&IP values in Flash, reset on long push-button
  change MAC&IP on command, within 30 seconds of short push-button (flicker LEDs)
  push MAC&IP to FPGA after FPGA boot
  poll server (simple counter at first), reset FPGA after 30 seconds of failure
  accumulate entropy from ADC
  do something with UART so hardware can be tested
  eventually speak DHCP to get IP based on MAC (configurable option)
  eventually participate in Siphash key management

Gateware feature wish-list:
  no soft core needed, right?
  should be usable as a golden image, as well as hardware verification
  step 1: [DONE] add i2cbridge and SPI micro hookup to a copy of badger/tests/rgmii_hw_test.v
  step 2: [DONE] add UDP for boot flash programming
  step 2a: add UDP for self-JTAG
  step 3: [DONE] do something with UART so hardware can be tested
  step 4: [DONE] add FMC tester support code
  step 5a: [DONE] add SPI control of WR DACs (2 x AD5662, separate SYNC#)
  step 5b: start on some kind of White Rabbit support or at least phase-locking VCXO
  step 6: test framework for DDR3, use LiteDRAM?
  The above steps are mostly orthogonal and could be pursued in parallel if we had a larger team

Other work:
  learn how to program FT4232H config EEPROM
    add device_desc and serial number, leave vid and pid alone?
    learn how to program/debug LPC1776 - [DONE] see bringup.txt
  test LPC1776 UART over USB
  use MMC to test features on I2C_PM bus: 2 x LM75 (thermometers),
    MAX6639 (thermometers, thermal shutdown, fans), XRP7724 (power supply)
  add MAC hookup to spi_gate, maybe try to use ENC28J60 paradigms?
  check that 88E1512 still works with VDDO_SEL tied low

Wishlist for next rev of Marble Mini hardware(relative to v1.0rc3)
  fix errata according to Michal:
  - USB FTDI - reset pin connect to VUSB
  - remove R225
  - remove F1 and F2
  - rotate LEDs
  - FPGA JTAG connector pin connect to P2V5
  - wrong transistors, BSS139 -> BSS138
  - change S25FL128S to S25FL128SAGMFIR01
  add rubber feet (with designated location) for desk use
  add mounting holes (standoffs)? (overlap with rubber feet)
  add physical power switch (includes barrel and PoE but not AMC?)
  add direct-attach LED or two to FPGA, maybe on interrupt line to MMC?
  add on-board SiLabs oscillator as option for MGT_CLK_0
    prototype first with Pmod from Michael?
  add 330 Ohm series resistor to all four FMC GA pins
  add power meter (another IN219) on 12V bulk input
    barrel-\         /---fans
    PoE--------vvv-------XR
    AMC----/         \---FMC
      (but 3V3MP is not supplied from that path, so not included)
  move parts between sides to reduce number of reels used in loading
    see stray_parts.py; moving 13 components could save 13 reels
    C2 C374 C42 D1 D2 Q19 Q2 R103 R104 R108 R160 R58 R66
  move U29 (I2C thermometer) to other end of board, near VCXOs
  use 10 Ohm instead of F1 and F2
  remove stray via at (272.35, 172.53)?
  reduce BOM line count in general, push-buttons in particular
  U4 (88E1512 Ethernet PHY): VDDO_SEL (10) should be tied low for VDDO = 2.5V
  more (labeled) test points, esp. power supplies
  if keeping J14 "Cortex Debug Connector" make a big pin-1 marking
    can we use a keyed/shrouded option for J14? Amphenol 20021221-00010C4LF
  update branding/naming on silkscreen
  more labels in general, e.g., DONE by associated LED
  much bigger silkscreen labels for user-facing parts:
    J9, J10, J11, J12, J13, J14, J15, J16, S1, SW1, SW2, SW3, M1, M2
  NAD builds can mark S1 as DNF
  AMC builds should mark Pmod J12, J13, J16 as DNF
  improve testablity in general
  improve documentation of build options
  schematic: clarify/unify net names +3.3VP (power), 3V3PM (AMC), +3V3MP (many)
  mark SFP TX_DIS pulldown resistors as 0 Ohm DNF: R84 R105 R185 R187
  increase voltage rating of capacitors attached to +12V to 25V (some are 16V)
