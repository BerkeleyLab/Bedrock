Marble demo project

Microprocessor "MMC" feature wish-list:
  eventually speak DHCP to get IP based on MAC (configurable option)
  eventually participate in Siphash key management

Gateware feature wish-list:
  should be usable as a golden image, as well as hardware verification
  step 2a: add UDP for self-JTAG
  step 5b: start on some kind of White Rabbit support or at least phase-locking VCXO
  step 6: test framework for DDR3, use LiteDRAM?
  The above steps are mostly orthogonal and could be pursued in parallel if we had a larger team

Other work:
  test LPC1776 UART over USB
  check that 88E1512 still works with VDDO_SEL tied low

Wishlist for next rev of Marble Mini hardware(relative to v1.0rc3)
  add physical power switch (includes barrel and PoE but not AMC?)
  improve documentation of build options
