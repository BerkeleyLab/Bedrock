Marble v1.3 s/n #45

Test:
-----
  cd badger/tests/
  # Set IDELAY value
  python3 -m scrap -t /dev/ttyUSB2 0 $IDELAY
  # Optionally readback IDELAY from ctl and data instances
  python3 -m scrap -t /dev/ttyUSB2 1 -r 2
  # Optionally Ping
  ping $IP
  # Run UDP test
  ./udprtx $IP 100000 8

Tabulate values from above test. Number failed and number timeouts are
reported from udprtx

(note: it seems like udprtx will send more packets than requested until
the requested number is received)
