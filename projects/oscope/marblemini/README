BMB-7 naming convention:
  fmc-lpc is FMC1 is P1
  fmc-hpc is FMC2 is P2

Due to different bank voltages for BMB-7 and Marble,
  need to map LVCMOS18 to LVCMOS25
  and LVDS to LVDS_25

example column output:
  prc_name              bmb7_iostandard  bmb7_pin  fmc_name     zest_pin
  bus_digitizer_U3[16]  LVDS_25          H23       FMC1_LA22_P  ADC_D0A_N_1
