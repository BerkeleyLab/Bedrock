Welcome to Bedrock's documentation!
===================================

This document is the user's manual of Bedrock, largely an accumulation
of Verilog codebase written over the past several years at LBNL.
It contains platform-independent Verilog, and whatever it takes to
get it onto FPGA platforms like Xilinx etc. The public development
mirror is the `Bedrock Github Repository`_.
