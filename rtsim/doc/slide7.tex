{\bf Detuning Filter Bank}

(from Holzbauer \& Schappert, 11/15/2016)

Discrete-time State Space Realization

General form for a system whose outputs and internal states
       depend linearly on the inputs and internal states

$u$ is the detuning

$y$ is the piezo drive signal

$x$ are estimates of the amplitudes of the cavity mechanical modes

${\bf A}$ can be decomposed into a 2$\times$2 block diagonal matrix,
      ideal for implementation in an FPGA firmware

$$\eqalign{
 x_{k+1} &= {\bf A} x_k~~~  + {\bf B} u_k\cr
 y_{k+1} &= {\bf C} x_{k+1} + {\bf D} u_k\cr}$$

$${\bf A}^{(j)} = \left[\matrix{
   e^{-\Delta t/\tau_j} \cos\omega_j\Delta t & e^{-\Delta t/\tau_j} \sin\omega_j\Delta t \cr
  -e^{-\Delta t/\tau_j} \sin\omega_j\Delta t & e^{-\Delta t/\tau_j} \cos\omega_j\Delta t \cr
}\right] $$

$${\bf B}^{(j)} = \left[\matrix{1\cr 0}\right]$$

$${\bf C}^{(j)} = \left[\matrix{
  G^{(j)} \cos \psi^{(j)} &
  G^{(j)} \sin \psi^{(j)} }\right]$$

{\bf Filter Bank: LBNL Implementation}

This exact filter bank abstraction was also implemented in LBNL's
{\tt resonator.v}, first checked into git in June, 2014.

For analysis purposes, slightly rearrange these equations.
Use $a_R$ and $a_I$ for the real and imaginary
parts of $\exp((-1/\tau_j + i\omega_j)\Delta t))$, and use $z$ as the
time step operator, to get

$$ \left( \matrix{z-a_R & -a_I\cr
                  a_I & z-a_R\cr}\right)
\left( \matrix{x_0 \cr x_1} \right)  =
\left( \matrix{u \cr 0} \right)  $$

$$ \left( \matrix{x_0 \cr x_1} \right) = {1\over D}
\left( \matrix{z-a_R & a_I\cr
                  -a_I & z-a_R\cr}\right)
\left( \matrix{u \cr 0} \right)  $$
where $D$ is the determinant $(z-a_R)^2 + a_I^2$.
$D$ correctly has roots at $a$ and $a^*$.  Using
$g_R$ and $g_I$ as the real and imaginary parts of $G^{(j)}\exp i\psi^{(j)}$,
$$ y = g_R x_0 + g_I x_1 $$
$$ y = { g_R (z-a_R) - g_I a_I \over z^2 -2a_Rz + a_R^2 + a_I^2} b_0 u ~~~.$$

We also need to take note that in {\tt resonator.v},
the value of $b$ is run
through a pseudo-floating-point shifter shared with $1-a_R$ and $a_R$.
To maintain precision on $1-a_R$ and $a_R$, at least for $Q > 0.5$,
a useful value to choose for $b_0$ is that which gives unity DC gain for the
low-pass filter (imaginary $g$) case,
$$ b_0 = {1 - 2a_R + a_R^2 a_I^2 \over | a_I | } ~~~. $$
% usually limits $b_0$ to something less than 1, which we can conservatively
% claim as $\max(1-a_R, |a_I|)$

Example time and frequency domain plots are shown for $a=\exp(-0.005 + 0.03i)$.

%In complex number form,
%$$ {\bf A}^{(j)} = \exp((-1/\tau_j + i\omega_j)\Delta t) $$
%$$ {\bf B}^{(j)} = 1 $$
%$$ {\bf C}^{(j)} = G^{(j)}\exp(i\psi^{(j)}) $$
%and typically ${\bf D}$ is zero.

Explicitly, the iteration expression in {\tt resonator.v} is scaled according
to
$$ x_{k+1} = x_k + (F x_k + B v_k) \cdot 4^{s-9} $$
where $s$ is an integer shift value, $0 \le s \le 7$.
Hence
$$ F = (a-1)\cdot 4^{9-s} $$
$$ B = b\cdot 4^{9-s} $$
and $s$ is chosen as the largest value such that the (absolute values of)
register values $F$ and $v$ remain less than one.
%  For strict sign agreement
% with the preceding analysis, verified in simulation, use
% $$ F = (a^*-1)\cdot 4^{9-s} $$

In the previous example, $a-1 = -0.005435 + 0.029846i$ and $b = 0.030836$,
so choose $s=7$, giving scaled values
$$\eqalign{
  F_R &= -0.08696 \cr
  F_I &=  0.47753 \cr
  B_R &=  0.49337 ~~~. \cr}$$
To get physical (signed integer) 18-bit register values, scale these real
numbers by $2^{17}$.  The full-scale negative value ($-2^{17}$) is
not valid for any coefficient register.

Absolute values of $1-a_R$, $a_I$, and $b$ $\ge$ 1/16 are not supported.

The imaginary part sign convention for $g$ used in {\tt dot\_prod.v}, and
therefore {\tt afilter\_siso.v}, is inverted compared with the rest of this document.

It can be noted in the graphs above that the filter gain can exceed
unity.  The state vector $x$ is internally saturated to stay (absolute value)
less than one, which will corrupt the frequency response if encountered.
This condition is detected in the hardware, and is made available for
external monitoring via {\tt afilter\_siso}'s {\tt res\_clip} port.
Mitigation involves reducing the value of $b$.

The implementation is heavily pipelined, and quite capable of clocking
at 200\thinspace MHz in a 7-series Xilinx chip.
