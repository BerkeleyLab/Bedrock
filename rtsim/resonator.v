// Propagate between 5 and 512 resonators, two clock cycles per resonator.
// Timing of input drive signal, and output position signal, are relative
// to the start pulse.

// Executes z * v_o = v_o + (a-1) * v_o + v_i
// where all quantities are complex, and a is the pole location.  Nominal
// configuration for second-order low-pass uses real number input, and
// the imaginary component of v_o is the output.  More precisely, it
// executes z * v_o = v_o + (wd * v_o + v_i) * 4^(scale-9)
// where wd = (a-1) * 4^(7-scale) and scale is between 0 and 7.
// The low-frequency gain in the low-pass configuration is -imag(1/wd)

// Considered z * v_o = v_o + (a-1) * (v_o + v_i), which has a simpler
// expression for gain, but rejected it because that would break the
// real/imaginary setup of a low-pass filter.

// The drive signal for mode 1, using coefficients kept at memory locations
// 2 and 3, needs to show up 12 and 13 cycles after the start pulse.
// The output will arrive 4 cycles after the drive.  These relations still
// hold if they pass over the following start pulse; everything is circular.
// But the pipeline length of 10 means the minimum number of resonators is 5.
// Of course, just because a resonator is in memory and gets processed,
// doesn't mean you have to feed it non-zero drive, or look at the result.

// Two 18x18 multipliers here; dwarfed by the multipliers used to
// compute dot products.  One set to convert physical excitation
// sources to the per-mode drive signal, and another set to convert
// from the abstract mode coordinates to the physical responses
// (cavity electrical mode frequency shifts).

// The size and speed of this module is such that it might be able to
// handle simulation of a whole cryomodule at once (8 cavities) in the
// XC7A200T of an AC701 board.
