There's too much fragile Unix magic in the makefile, try replacing
  some awk, grep, and paste with python.

[Maybe done, not tested] Modify sf_user.v to take the input stream in a timing
  structure that is compatible with AXI-stream-lite.
  Involved adding a clock-enable line to all registers in sf_main.v

Unfinished business, conceptually easy:
  tune the shift values chosen in cgen_ip3.py

Done:
  think more about precision in the accumulation step (a3+=D*foo)
    adder data path is now wider, and multiplier result lsb's are kept,
    so just use a small D value

Confidence-building step:
  use sim1.c as a plugin to llrf/theory/distort/essay Octave

To change the number of guard bits (to the right of the 18 used by the
  multiplier input), you need to change:
    extra in user_tb.v
    maybe the TIMESPEC in blank_s3.ucf and blank_s6.ucf
