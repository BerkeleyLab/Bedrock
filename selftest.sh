# Mostly covers the test stage of bedrock gitlab CI, plus flake8.
# Collected and cleaned up from scattered .gitlab* .yml files.
# Running this script is possibly easier than fussing with Docker,
# and definitely gives more test coverage than typing "make" in whatever
# directory you're developing in.  Measured execution time is about
# three minutes on decent hardware (Ryzen 5 PRO 5650GE).

# Can be run as an unprivileged user on a pretty basic Debian Bookworm
# system, or other recent-enough Linux distributions.
# apt-get install -y build-essential git iverilog tcl flake8
# apt-get install -y python3-yaml python3-scipy python3-matplotlib
# apt-get install -y verilator yosys
# On older systems, including Debian Bullseye and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS,
# you'll have to instead build verilator v4.220 or later and yosys 0.23
# or later from source, since the distribution's published versions are
# too old and buggy.

# An enhanced set of tests can be selected with "$1" = "more".
# The additional setup on Debian Bullseye or Bookworm isn't so bad:
# apt-get install -y gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf picolibc-riscv64-unknown-elf
# pip3 install nmigen==0.2

# Suggest (but don't mandate) running with flags set:
# sh -ex selftest.sh
# or for more complete tests:
# sh -ex selftest.sh more

# XXX could/should we do a git clean -fdx between steps?

# Print some system status and tool versions
# When run with -e, will cause early failure if something is missing
