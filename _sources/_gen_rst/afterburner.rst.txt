afterburner
===========

Description
'''''''''''

|  Synthesizes to 47 slices and 1 MULT18X18 at 166 MHz in XC3Sxxx-4 using XST-9.2.04i
|   Use parameter triple instead of preprocessor variable AFTERBURNER_TRIPLE
|   User port coeff instead of parameter coeff
|  If the port coeff is set to a constant value, should synthesize identically
|  There is a latency of 3 clock cycles (??)
|  Note: The output of the module is Offset Binary
|  [It is perhaps stupid to have that here and it should be moved into another module]
| 
|  CONCEPT: The mid point along the circle of a of 2 complex numbers that already lie
|           on a circle is not a plain average. To obtain the (real/imaginary) component
|           of this mid-point one has to multiply by what is called "coeff"
|           k = 0.5*sec(theta) .. where theta is the angle between the complex numbers
