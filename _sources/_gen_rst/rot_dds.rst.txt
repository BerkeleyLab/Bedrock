Description
'''''''''''

|  Phase Rotating Direct Digital Synthesis of sin/cos
|  18 bit output coming from cordicg
|  Note that phase_step_h and phase_step_l combined fit in a 32-bit word.
|  This is intentional, to allow atomic updates of the two controls
|  in 32-bit systems.  Indeed, when modulo==0, those 32 bits can be considered
| 
|  a simple fast binary DDS control for quirky (non-binary-rounding) phase
|  steps like:
|  7/33 for LCLS-II
|  8/11 for SSRF
|  9/13 for Argonne RIA
| 
|  The phase generation algorithm
|  0. The phase increments for dds are generated using a technique described
|  in these 2 places:
|  Section: PROGRAMMABLE MODULUS MODE in:
|   https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad9915.pdf
|   (AND) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm
|   Basically, increment the phase step at a coarse resolution, accumulate the
|   error on the side, and when that error accumulates to the lowest bit of
|   the coarse counter, add an extra 1 to the following phase step.
|  1. phase_step_h is the coarse (20 bit) integer truncated phase increment for
|   the cordic. There is a 1-bit increment of phase that comes from
|   accumulating residue phase.
|  2. This residue phase is accumulating in steps of phase_step_l, in a 12-bit
|   counter.
|  3. However, there will be an extra residue even for this 12-bit counter,
|  which is the modulus, and this added as an offset when the counter crosses 0
| 
|  12-bit modulo supports largest known periodicity in a suggested LLRF system,
|  1427 for JLab.  For more normal periodicities, use a multiple to get finer
|  granularity.
|  Note that the downloaded modulo control is the 2's complement of the
|  mathematical modulus.
|  e.g., SSRF IF/F_s ratio 8/11, use
|      modulo = 4096 - 372*11 = 4
|      phase_step_h = 2^20*8/11 = 762600
|      phase_step_l = (2^20*8%11)*372 = 2976
|  e.g., Argonne RIA test IF/F_s ratio 9/13, use
|      modulo = 4096 - 315*13 = 1
|      phase_step_h = 2^20*9/13 = 725937
|      phase_step_l = (2^20*9%13)*315 = 945
| 
|  TODO:
|  Potentially, isolate phase generation into a separate module.
|  Haha, turns out there is ph_acc.v (We should USE it).
|  Synthesizes to ??? slices at ??? MHz in XC3Sxxx-4 using XST-??
