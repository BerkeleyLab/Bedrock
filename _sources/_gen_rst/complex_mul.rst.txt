Description
'''''''''''

| 
|  Complex number multiplication, as in
|    (a+ib)*(c+id) = (a*c-b*d)+i(a*d+b*c).
|  All the complex numbers are IQ-serialized, such that port x
|  carries a+ib, port y carries c+id, and port z carries the result.
| 
|  It produces up to one answer every two clock cycles.
|  The 18-bit inputs and output are assumed scaled to [-1,1).
| 
|  This module uses two 18-bit signed hardware multipliers,
|  and can clock at over 100 MHz in Spartan-6.
| 
|  It's pretty easy to ask for results that would overflow the representable
|  numbers; an extreme case is (1+i)*(1-i) = 2.  All such results get
|  saturated to the maximum representable positive or negative number.
| 
|  A second copy of the result with no rounding error is also provided
|  in z_all.  Using both outputs will consume more FPGA resources than
|  using either one alone.
| 
|  Output results are delayed four cycles from the input.
|  The gate_out port is nothing more or less than the gate_in
|  port, delayed four cycles.  Only the iq control is used to control
|  the data paths inside this module.
