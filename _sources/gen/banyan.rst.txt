Description
'''''''''''

|  permute np ports, each dw bits wide, using rl levels of 2-way mux
|   np must be 2**rl
| 
|  Networking equipment with similar topology is known as a Banyan switch,
|  so I'll use that name.  A non-folded Banyan switch actually has two
|  switches of this type back-to-back; I can leave off the second half
|  because in my application the output channels are fungible.
| 
|  The intended use case is to route 8 x ADC data to 8 x data sinks,
|  in any of the following configurations:
|   8 parallel  :   1 combination    x  1 time state
|   4 parallel  :  70 combinations   x  2 time states
|   2 parallel  :  28 combinations   x  4 time states
|   1 at a time :   8 possibilities  x  8 time states
|  for 1*1 + 70*2 + 28*4 + 8*8 = 317 useful configurations
| 
|  Represent the channel selection configuration with an 8-bit mask of
|  which channels to look at.  Only 1+70+28+8 = 107 of 256 possible masks
|  are valid, since it's invalid to have 0, 3, 5, 6, or 7 bits set.
|  Configuration also includes 3 bits of time_state.
| 
|  time_state and mask_in are processed at full bandwidth.
|  There are rl+1 cycles of latency from a change of these
|  control inputs to the new data_out permutation appearing.
|  There are only rl cycles of latency to mask_out.
| 
|  The implementation is done with recursive instantiation of itself.
|  The capability of doing recursion in Verilog is explicitly acknowledged
|  and blessed by the Verilog-2005 standard, and it works without problem
|  for me in Icarus Verilog, Verilator, Xilinx XST, and Xilinx Vivado.
| 
|  An N=8 dw=16 instantiation in Kintex speed grade 2 seems capable of
|  running at ridiculous clock rates (over 550 MHz?), consuming on the
|  order of 430 LUT.  The data muxes alone ought to use 384 LUT outputs.
|  Even a lowly Spartan-6 should manage 160 MHz, using about 226 LUT
|  (437 LUT outputs).
| 
|  Used successfully on hardware since 2016.
