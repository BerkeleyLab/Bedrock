# EVent Generator (EVG) and EVent Receiver (EVR)

The EVG/EVR timing system is based on the [Micro-Research Finland (MRF) timing architecture](http://www.mrf.fi/dmdocuments/EVG-TREF-004.pdf).  
This architecture is widely used in accelerator facilities, including:

- **LBNL ALS / ALS-U** synchrotron light source
- **SLAC LCLS-I** (LEMP timing system)

Both systems derive their timing from the MRF model, with site-specific customizations.

## Overview of EVG/EVR Operation

The **EVG** transmits timing information as a continuous stream of **event frames**.  
Each frame contains:

- **8-bit Event Code** – identifies the timing event  
- **8-bit Distributed Data Bus** – carries 8 parallel signals, sampled at the event clock rate

The **Distributed Data Bus** is used to transmit multiple simultaneous binary signals alongside the event code.  
This allows for real-time broadcast of fast control/status flags without requiring additional event codes.

### Event Transmission Rules
- **Maximum event codes:** 256 (0x00–0xFF)
- **Only one event code is transmitted at a time**
- If there is no specific event to transmit, the EVG sends:
  - **Null event code** (`0x00`), or
  - **Special K28.5 comma character** (`0xBC`) for alignment

The **K28.5** character is used by EVRs to synchronize to the correct word boundary in the serial stream.

### Standard Event Code Definitions
| Event Code  |         Description           |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| `0x01–0x6F` |     User-defined events       |
| `0x70`      | Seconds counter, byte 0 (LSB) |
| `0x71`      |     Seconds counter, byte 1   |
| `0x72–0x79` |        User-defined events    |
| `0x7A`      |         Heartbeat             |
| `0x7B`      |      Synchronize prescalers   |
| `0x7C`      |  Timestamp counter increment  |
| `0x7D`      |    Timestamp counter reset    |
| `0x7F`      |        End of Sequence        |

## ALS / ALS-U Implementation
- **EVR Hardware:**  
  - Marble board or Xilinx ZCU208 FPGA board  
  - GTX or GTY transceivers  
  - SI570 programmable oscillator for reference clock generation

- **Distributed Data Bus Usage:**  
  - Bit 0 → General-purpose signal  
  - Bit 1 → Heartbeat (HB)  
  - Bit 2 → 100 kHz reference signal  
  - Remaining bits → Reserved or user-defined

## LCLS-I Implementation
- **EVR Hardware:**
  - Marble board
  - SI570 oscillator programmed to **119 MHz**

- **Reference Frequency Derivation:**  
  - Master Oscillator (MO) frequency: 476 MHz 
  - 119 MHz = MO / 4 = 476 MHz / 4

- **Timing Pattern Transmission:**  
  - LCLS-I sends timing pattern frames at **120 Hz**
  - In some modes, 119 MHz is divided down to **360 Hz**
  - `119 MHz / 360 Hz ≈ 330,000 clock cycles` per 360 Hz period  
  - Of these, **33 timing slots** are used to transmit **pulse ID** or other control patterns

## Transceiver configuration (TODO: Make GTY also generic and add GTP)
The `gt_tcl` directory contains all the **TCL scripts** required for **GTX/GTY transceiver configuration**.
- **Example usage:**
  To use `evr_gtx.tcl`, you must pass the **reference frequency** as a parameter.
  The script will then **automatically compute the line rate** based on the provided reference frequency.

#### Notes on Distributed Bus Usage
The **8-bit distributed bus** exists because some timing signals need to be broadcast continuously and in parallel with event codes.  
Examples include:
- Machine status flags
- Fast interlocks
- Beam mode indicators
- RF synchronization markers
This allows the EVR to act on both **event-based triggers** and **continuous state signals** without extra latency.
